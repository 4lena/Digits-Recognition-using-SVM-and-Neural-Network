# Digits Recognition Using SVM and Neural Network

## About The Project
Building a multi-class classifier for the MNIST dataset, which is a large database of handwritten digits. The first step is to preprocess the dataset by normalizing and reshaping the data. Then, three SVM models with different parameters are built to evaluate which one performs the best. Two neural network models with different configurations are also built and compared with the SVM models to determine which model performs the best for this problem. The evaluation is done by comparing the accuracy of each model on a validation set. The ultimate goal is to find the best model that accurately classifies the handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset.
